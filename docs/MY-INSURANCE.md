## Routes

- `/tools/prescription-drug-list`  
- `/calculators/aca-subsidy`, `/tools/cost-estimator`  
- Auth: `/auth/insurance/*`, `/api/insurance-auth/*`  

## Shortlist vs compare

- **Shortlist** = `saved_providers` (Save to My Insurance)  
- **Compare tray** = localStorage (up to 4) + optional cloud save to `provider_comparisons`  

## Reviews

- Auth required via My Insurance form  
- Status `pending` until moderated  
- Published reviews appear on provider profiles (existing published query)  
- User sees own reviews (any status) in HQ

No lead selling, no paid placements, no invented verification badges.
